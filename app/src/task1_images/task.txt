# Task:
# In each pair of consecutive frames
# align the first frame to the second one using homography.
# After homography calculation align corresponding probability maps (1-4) in the same way,
# then average each pair (aligned 1st map - original 2nd map)
# and save as a new image file.

# Deliverable:
# code/function that takes as input two filenames in the certain folder,
# returns 4 averaged probability maps
# and saved in Avg directory with the same names as maps files of the second frame.

# Idea:
# get more robust predictions based on two consecutive frames.
